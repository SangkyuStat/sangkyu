I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics and Probability, Michigan State University and also a predoctoral fellow in the Biostatistics Branch of DCEG at National Cancer Institute, NIH. I am broadly interested about various statistical topics and programming but my research focuses on machine learning, quantile regression, survival data anlalysis and high-dimensional data analysis.
