abstract: Intuitively, a test with more assumptions has greater power than a test with fewer assumptions. This kind of examples are abundant in the nonparametric tests vs corresponding parametric ones. In general, the nonparametric tests are less efficient in terms of asymptotic relative efficiency (ARE) compared to corresponding parametric tests (Daniel, 1990). However, this is not always true. To test equal means under independent normal samples, the usual test involves using the t-distribution with the pooled estimator of the common variance. Adding the assumption of equal sample size, we may derive another test. In this case, two tests using more assumptions were performed for univariate (multivariate) cases. For these examples, it was found that the power function of a test with more assumptions is less than or equal to that of a test with fewer assumptions. This finding can be used as an expository example in masterâ€™s mathematical statistics courses.
