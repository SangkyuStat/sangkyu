abstract: Counterexamples of a skew-normal distribution are developed to improve our understanding of this distribu-tion. Two examples on bivariate non-skew-normal distribution owning marginal skew-normal distributions arefirst provided. Sum of dependent skew-normal and normal variables does not follow a skew-normal distribution.Continuous bivariate density with discontinuous marginal density also exists in skew-normal distribution. Anexample presents that the range of possible correlations for bivariate skew-normal distribution is constrained in arelatively small set. For unified skew-normal variables, an example about converging in law are discussed. Con-vergence in distribution is involved in two separate examples for skew-normal variables. The point estimationproblem, which is not a counterexample, is provided because of its importance in understanding the skew-normaldistribution. These materials are useful for undergraduate and/or graduate teaching courses.
